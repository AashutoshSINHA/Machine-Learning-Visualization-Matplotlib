# Machine-Learning-Visualization-Matplotlib
## What you can learn from it?
1. Visualizing a Function as an Image and a Contour.
2. You can visualize the function as a contour too.
3. You can create a 3D vignette visualization.
4. You can create decorated scatter plots with Matplotlib. 
5. You can visualize time plots and signals.
6. You can also multiply two signals.
7. You can fill in the empty spaces within the boundaries of plots.
8. Step Plots - visualization of sine waves.
9. Hexbins Plots.
10. You can visualize plots in the XKCD style. The XKCD is a popular a web comic. 
11. You can visualize 2D histograms too in the same way.
12. learned about histogram
 This Matplotlib practice code series will help the learners to get a better understanding of its use in Python for Data Science and Machine Learning.
